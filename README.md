# Educational eCommerce application
My first **ASP.NET Core MVC** web application I made for educational purposes. It's an online movie tickets shop.

This application implements such functions as:
+ Create, Edit, Delete and View information about Movies, Actors, Producers and Cinemas.
+ Login and registration functionality
+ Market cart and purchase movie tickets functionality, etc.

With this project I'm studying **ASP.NET** platform, **MVC** pattern to build an application, **Entity Framework** to use with **MS SQL** database, **GIT** to learn how to use version control system and some functionality of the Bootstrap library to understand how the front-end part of the application is built.

This application is still in production and not finished yet.
